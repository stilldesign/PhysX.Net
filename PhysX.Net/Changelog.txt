[0.10.0.0 - ]
Changed to PhysX SDK 2.8.1 - Check the official change log
Removed the 'Base' prefix from abstract class names, no need for it, conforms to .Net naming and PhysX naming better
Added Timing to Compartment
Added checks for null and disposed parameters to lots of functions
Removed FluidDescriptionBase.SetInitialParticleData and FluidDescriptionBase.SetParticleWriteData.
Added FluidDescriptionBase.ParticleDeletionIdWriteData, FluidDescriptionBase.ParticleCreationIdWriteData, FluidDescriptionBase.FluidPacketData
FluidDescriptionBase. { InitialParticleData, ParticleWriteData, ParticleDeletionIdWriteData, ParticleCreationIdWriteData, FluidPacketData } are all created when the constructor is called as per the SDK
Changed AllocateCommonParticleData to an instance call
Slight speed up to FluidEmitter.LoadFromDescription. Fixed FluidEmitter.SaveToDescription not saving the FrameShape
Removed OverlapAABBTrianglesResult. Cloth.OverlapAABBTriangles return null if no overlap, the indices otherwise
Fixed removing a shape description from the actor description
ControllerManagement is now ControllerManager
Controller has a Manager property
Fixed bug in the joint constructor. Actor2 was being assigned to actor1
SweepQueryHit is now a (reference) class
Fixed bug when assigning a compartment to a actor description base
MeshData correctly clones a NxMeshData/MeshData
Actor.SaveBodyToDescription() now returns null if actor has no body instead of throwing an exception
Optimized EntityShapeReport for much better speed
WheelContactModify actually works now
User* reports no longer need the scene passed in as an argument
Fixed bug where Shape.CCDSkeleton was not populated on construction of the shape. Value comes from the descriptor
*.SetToDefault() works much better. Managed references are nulled out, or defaulted themselves.
Joint.GetLimitPoint() is now of type Vector3?. The return is null if the internal functions NxJoint::getLimitPoint() returns false

[0.9.1.0 - 2008-06-28]
Fixed WheelShape.GetContactData()
WheelShape.GetContactData() returns an empty struct when no contact occurs rather than undefined memory
Added WheelContactData.ContactPosition
Added comments to WheelContactData

Renamed Tag property to UserData
Fixed bug where the 'default material' (i.e index 0) can be disposed of, this is not allowed in PhysX. This fixes the bug where disposal of a material means the default material is reassigned to the shape which caused the program to crash because the wrapper is unable to find the default material in the list.
Changed CommonParticleData.Flags to CommonParticleData.Flag
Added FluidEmitter.Fluid
Changed FluidEmitter.NumberOfParticleEmitted to Fluid.NumberOfParticlesEmitted
Changed Shape.Raycast to return a RaycastHit instead of using an out parameter as specified by the .Net design guidelines

DescriptorValidity on many description classes instead of bool. DescriptorValidity is backwards compat with the bool return type via an implicit conversion operator
ActorDescription implements IsValid, previously only ActorDescriptionBase.IsValid was being called
Renamed DefaultUserOutputStream to ConsoleOutputStream
Removed IStreamReader and IStreamWriter. Instead you only need to use System.IO.Stream implemented classes, usually these will be MemoryStream, FileStream or BinaryStream

Actor.AddShape is now Actor.CreateShape, added wheel shape creation

[0.8.9.0 - 2008-05-03]
Few minor changes to controller enums
Changed Controller::Move; removed the CollisionGroup enum, it now takes an unsigned int. Also the other Move function now passes in 0xFFFFFFFF (i.e. 11111111111111111111111111111111 base 2) so all group are active.
Fixed up controller hit
Fixed access modifiers on CCDSkeleton
Fixed up Capsule Shape Description; removed unused pointer and set correct access modifiers
Added ConvexForceFieldShapeDescription and ConvexForceFieldShape
Abstracted the pointers in the force field shape descriptors. Removed the empty specific finalizers
Minor performance improvements for searching for managed instances
Removed finalizers and deconstructors from force field shapes
Added UserWheelContactModify and associated properties to WheelShapeDescription and WheelShape
Removed finalizers and deconstructors from all the shapes and shape descriptions; they were empty functions or setting managed variables to null which is not required. Inherited deconstructor and finalizer still exist.

Removed Scene.GetMaterial(), use scene.Materials[ index ] instead
Adding shapes to an actor (using Actor.AddShape) now correctly adds them to the shape collection in the scene
SimpleTriangleMesh creates VerticesStream and TriangleStream when using the constructor SimpleTriangleMesh( NxSimpleTriangleMesh* simpleTriangleMesh );. This constructor is now protected. This also fixes calling TriangleMesh.SaveToDescription having null VerticesStream and TriangleStream in the returned descriptor
hanged Cloth::Create to Cloth::FromUnmanagedPointer to match coding style
Cloth::SaveToDescription now saves MeshData and ClothMesh properties, and doesn't require a core to be passed in

Fixed Cloth returning a Ray ref instead of a Ray value
The binary is now signed

Added UserActorPairFiltering and associated


[0.8.8.0 - 2008-04-10]

The wrapper is now built with DirectX April 2005 SDK (v25)
Managed DirectX version is included in releases now
Fixed up Scene Description;
	it implements IDisposable
	removed IName inheritence
	it has a correct finalizer now
	added the remaining functions
	fixed Gravity returning only the x component for each vector element, i.e. ( x, x, x )

Added Bounds3.Extremes. This creates a bounds3 with the min and max properties set to Single.MaxValue and Single.MinValue respectively. Use this instead of the default constructor.
Removed IName and INameNotifiable from classes, not part of the SDK. Thus objects no longer get nice names when they are created, just assign them manually if you need them
Fixed up WheelShape finalizer
Changed TireFunctionDescription to ValueType
Fixed and Changed Simple Triangle Mesh;
	Removed the Write/Read Vertices/Indices functions and replaced it with PhysicsStream. With this users can now interleave data and it conforms much better to the actual SDK. Physics Stream provides conveniance functions to replace the Write/Read Vertices/Indices functions.
	Its now releases the allocated vertices and indices where as it didnot before.
	Vertex Count and Index Count must now be set
Cooking now uses the cooking parameters supplied in the non blank constructor
RayCast is now Raycast
BaseRaycastReport is now UserRaycastReport
Changed UserContactReport::OnContactNotify's second param to ContactPairFlag
